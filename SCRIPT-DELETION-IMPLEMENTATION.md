# Script Deletion Implementation in PSScript

This document provides an overview of the script deletion functionality in the PSScript application and the files created to support and test this functionality.

## Existing Functionality

The PSScript application already has script deletion functionality implemented:

### Backend Implementation

1. **ScriptController.deleteScript** - Method in `src/backend/src/controllers/ScriptController.ts` that handles deleting individual scripts.
2. **Bulk Delete Endpoint** - Route in `src/backend/src/routes/scripts.ts` that handles bulk deletion of scripts.

### Frontend Implementation

1. **ScriptManagement Component** - Component in `src/frontend/src/pages/ScriptManagement.tsx` that provides UI for both individual and bulk script deletion.
2. **API Service** - Methods in `src/frontend/src/services/api.ts` for `deleteScript` and `bulkDeleteScripts`.

## Fixed Issues

The following issues with the script deletion functionality have been fixed:

1. **Bulk Delete Error Handling** - Fixed an issue in the bulk delete endpoint that was causing 500 Internal Server Error when deleting multiple scripts. The fix includes:
   - Converting string IDs to numbers for consistent comparison
   - Adding better error handling for individual script deletion failures
   - Ensuring proper transaction rollback in case of errors
   - Adding consistent success flag in response objects

2. **Database-Level Cascade Deletion** - Enhanced data integrity by adding ON DELETE CASCADE constraints to all foreign key references to the scripts table:
   - Modified `src/db/schema.sql` to include ON DELETE CASCADE for all script-related tables
   - Created migration file `src/db/migrations/07_add_cascade_delete_constraints.sql` to apply these constraints to existing databases
   - Created script `run-cascade-delete-migration.sh` to run the migration
   - This ensures that when a script is deleted, all related data in dependent tables is automatically deleted by the database, providing a robust safety net

## Files Created

To support and document the script deletion functionality, the following files have been created:

1. **SCRIPT-DELETION-GUIDE.md** - A user guide that explains how to delete scripts in the PSScript application, including:
   - Individual script deletion from the Script Management page
   - Individual script deletion from the Script Detail page
   - Bulk script deletion from the Script Management page
   - Programmatic deletion using the API

2. **test-script-deletion.js** - A Node.js script that tests both individual and bulk script deletion functionality:
   - Creates test scripts for individual deletion
   - Creates test scripts for bulk deletion
   - Tests individual script deletion
   - Tests bulk script deletion
   - Reports test results

3. **run-script-deletion-test.sh** - A shell script that runs the script deletion test:
   - Checks if Node.js is installed
   - Installs the axios package if needed
   - Sets the API URL environment variable if provided
   - Runs the test script
   - Reports test results

4. **src/db/migrations/07_add_cascade_delete_constraints.sql** - A migration file that adds ON DELETE CASCADE constraints to all script-related tables:
   - Identifies existing foreign key constraints
   - Drops them
   - Recreates them with ON DELETE CASCADE
   - Handles error cases gracefully

5. **run-cascade-delete-migration.sh** - A shell script that runs the migration to add ON DELETE CASCADE constraints:
   - Checks if Node.js is installed
   - Installs required packages if needed
   - Runs the migration using the generic migration runner
   - Reports results

## How to Test Script Deletion

To test the script deletion functionality:

1. Ensure the PSScript application is running.
2. Run the test script:

```bash
./run-script-deletion-test.sh
```

3. Optionally, specify a custom API URL:

```bash
./run-script-deletion-test.sh http://your-api-url/api
```

The test script will create test scripts, delete them individually and in bulk, and report the results.

## How to Apply Database Constraints

To apply the ON DELETE CASCADE constraints to an existing database:

1. Run the migration script:

```bash
./run-cascade-delete-migration.sh
```

This will update the database schema to ensure that when a script is deleted, all related data is automatically deleted as well.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with script deletion:

1. Check the server logs for error messages.
2. Ensure the database is properly configured and accessible.
3. Verify that the user has the necessary permissions to delete scripts.
4. Check the network requests in the browser's developer tools to see if the API calls are being made correctly.
5. If you encounter database constraint errors during migration, check the PostgreSQL logs for detailed error messages.

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements to the script deletion functionality:

1. Add a confirmation dialog with script details before deletion.
2. Implement a "trash" or "archive" feature instead of permanent deletion.
3. Add the ability to restore deleted scripts within a certain time period.
4. Implement batch operations for scripts based on filters (e.g., delete all scripts older than X days).
5. Add a database cleanup utility to find and remove any orphaned records that might have been created before the ON DELETE CASCADE constraints were added.
