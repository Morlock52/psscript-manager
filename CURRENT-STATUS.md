# PSScript Current Status

## Application Access
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3002
- **Backend**: http://localhost:4000
- **AI Service**: http://localhost:8000

## Login Instructions
1. Go to http://localhost:3002/login
2. Use credentials:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `TestPassword123`

## Fixed Issues
✅ CORS error for x-openai-api-key header - now sent in request body
✅ 403 Forbidden on secure storage - added development mode detection
✅ Authentication fallback for development mode
✅ Chat endpoint format issues

## Known Issues
1. **SVG viewBox errors** - These are from a Chrome extension (MindStudio), not the app
2. **Authentication backend** - Using development mode fallback due to Sequelize initialization issue

## To Use AI Features
1. Go to Settings (http://localhost:3002/settings)
2. Enter your OpenAI API key
3. Save settings
4. The key will be stored in localStorage

## Chat Functionality
- The chat now has better error handling
- Falls back to mock responses if API key is missing or invalid
- Validates API key length before attempting real API calls

## Script Analysis
- Fixed CORS issues by sending API key in request body
- Backend updated to accept API key from body or header

## What's Working
✅ Frontend application
✅ Development mode authentication
✅ Chat with mock responses
✅ Settings management
✅ Script upload and analysis (with API key)
✅ All UI features

## Next Steps
The application is fully functional for development use. The main remaining issue is the backend authentication system which needs the Sequelize models properly initialized.
