# Database Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the database connectivity and infrastructure of the PSScript application.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Database Connection Enhancements
- Implemented robust database connection handler with proper error typing and exponential backoff
- Added intelligent error categorization (authentication, network, timeout, resource, etc.)
- Improved connection pooling configuration with optimized settings
- Added support for both individual parameters and DATABASE_URL connection string

### 2. Migration Management
- Created a robust migration tracking system with `schema_migrations` table
- Added transaction support for safer migrations
- Fixed migration ordering and dependency issues
- Implemented comprehensive error handling for migration failures

### 3. pgvector Integration
- Added proper pgvector extension installation and verification
- Created vector indexes for both script embeddings and chat history
- Added error handling for systems without pgvector

### 4. Redis and Caching
- Implemented a fault-tolerant caching mechanism with Redis
- Added graceful fallback to in-memory cache when Redis is unavailable
- Implemented health monitoring and automatic fallback/recovery
- Enhanced cache interface with type-safe operations

### 5. Testing and Diagnostics
- Improved database connection tests with more comprehensive diagnostics
- Enhanced error handling and reporting for both PostgreSQL and Redis
- Added detailed logging for connection issues and migrations
- Created combined setup and test script for easier verification

## Setup Instructions

To set up the database from scratch:

```bash
# Initialize database schema and tables
node setup-database.js

# Run migrations for any additional schema changes
node run-migration.js

# Check pgvector extension status
node check-pgvector.js

# Full setup and testing (recommended)
node setup-and-test.js
```

## Configuration

Database configuration can be specified in two ways:

1. **Individual Parameters**:
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=psscript
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=postgres
   DB_SSL=false
   ```

2. **Connection String**:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/psscript
   ```

## Redis Configuration

Redis can be configured with the following parameters:

```
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

The system will automatically fall back to in-memory caching if Redis is unavailable.

## Testing

To test the database and caching system:

```bash
# Test PostgreSQL connectivity
cd src/backend && node test-db.js

# Test Redis/caching
cd src/backend && node test-redis.js
```

## Additional Notes

- The application will automatically create the database schema if it doesn't exist
- Migrations are now tracked in the database to prevent duplicate runs
- Vector search capabilities are available when pgvector is installed
- The caching system will automatically use the best available option (Redis or in-memory)
