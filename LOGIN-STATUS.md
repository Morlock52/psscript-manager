# PSScript Login Status

## Current Status

The authentication system has a backend issue that's preventing proper login. I've implemented a temporary development mode fallback so you can use the application while we fix the backend.

## How to Login

### Development Mode (Working Now)
1. Go to http://localhost:3002/login
2. Use these credentials:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `TestPassword123`
3. The frontend will authenticate you in development mode

### What's Working
- ✅ Frontend authentication flow
- ✅ Secure storage with localStorage fallback
- ✅ Chat functionality (with your OpenAI API key)
- ✅ All UI features
- ✅ Settings page

### What Needs Fixing
- ❌ Backend auth endpoints returning 500 error
- ❌ Possible Sequelize model initialization issue
- ❌ Redis connectivity (optional but configured)

## Backend Issue Details

The backend authentication is failing with a 500 error. Investigation shows:
1. Database connection is working
2. User exists in database with correct password
3. JWT_SECRET is configured
4. Issue appears to be with Sequelize model initialization

## Next Steps

1. **For immediate use**: The development mode fallback allows full use of the application
2. **To fix backend**: Need to debug Sequelize model initialization in the auth controller
3. **Alternative**: Could implement a simpler auth endpoint that bypasses Sequelize

## Test Account

- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `TestPassword123`
- Username: `testuser`
- Role: `admin`

This account exists in the database and the password has been verified to be correct.
