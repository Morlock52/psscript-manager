*   [X] **Script Deletion:** Review and fix the script deletion process, ensuring all related data (metadata, analysis, embeddings, history) is handled correctly and securely. (Added: 2025-04-01) (Completed: 2025-04-01)

## IV. Frontend (React/TypeScript/Vite)

*   [ ] **Component Library:** Develop/refine reusable UI components using Material UI and Tailwind CSS.
*   [ ] **Routing:** Implement clear and logical navigation using `react-router-dom`.
*   [ ] **State Management:** Optimize data fetching and caching with `react-query`. Manage global UI state effectively (Context API or other).
*   [ ] **API Integration:** Ensure robust API calls with proper error handling and loading states.
*   [ ] **UI/UX:** Improve user interface design and user experience based on feedback or design mockups.
*   [ ] **Monaco Editor:** Enhance code editor features (syntax highlighting for PowerShell, intellisense if possible).
*   [ ] **Data Visualization:** Implement/improve charts and visualizations for analytics.
*   [ ] **Markdown/Syntax Highlighting:** Ensure correct rendering of markdown and code snippets.
*   [ ] **Forms:** Implement user-friendly forms with client-side validation.
*   [X] **Voice Integration:** Implemented core UI components for voice input recording, playback, and settings. Further refinement, accessibility, and polish planned.
*   [ ] **Error Handling:** Provide clear user feedback for errors (using `react-hot-toast` or similar).
*   [ ] **Performance:** Optimize frontend performance (code splitting, lazy loading, bundle size reduction).
*   [ ] **Accessibility:** Ensure the UI meets accessibility standards (WCAG).

## V. AI Service (Python/FastAPI)

*   [ ] **Analysis Logic:** Improve the accuracy and scope of AI-powered script analysis.
*   [ ] **Embedding Model:** Evaluate and potentially update the text embedding model used for vector search.
*   [ ] **Similarity Search:** Optimize vector search queries and result ranking.
*   [ ] **Chat/Agent Logic:** Enhance the capabilities and conversational flow of the AI chat agent (Langchain).
*   [ ] **Voice Processing:** Improve accuracy and latency of voice transcription and speech synthesis. Handle different voice providers.
*   [ ] **API Endpoints:** Refine FastAPI endpoints for clarity, performance, and error handling.
*   [ ] **Database Interaction:** Optimize database queries related to analysis results and embeddings.
*   [ ] **Caching:** Implement effective caching for expensive AI operations or external API calls.
*   [ ] **Error Handling:** Improve error handling and reporting for AI tasks.
*   [ ] **External API Keys:** Securely manage API keys for OpenAI and Cloud Voice services.

## VI. Executor Service (Node.js)

*   [ ] **Security Hardening:** Enhance the security of the PowerShell execution environment (e.g., restrict network access, limit execution time/resources).
*   [ ] **API Security:** Secure the internal API endpoint (e.g., API key validation).
*   [ ] **Output Handling:** Improve capturing and streaming of script output (stdout, stderr).
*   [ ] **Error Reporting:** Provide detailed error information back to the backend service.

## VII. Deployment & Operations

*   [ ] **Dockerfile Optimization:** Reduce image sizes and build times using multi-stage builds and layer caching.
*   [ ] **Production Configuration:** Finalize Docker Compose setup for production (Nginx configuration, resource limits, restart policies).
*   [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing, building, and deployment.
*   [ ] **Infrastructure:** Plan and provision necessary cloud infrastructure if deploying outside local Docker.
*   [ ] **Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive monitoring (application performance, resource usage, logs) using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, or cloud provider services.
