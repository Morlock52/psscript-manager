# PSScript Platform - World-Class Transformation Roadmap 2025

## Executive Summary
Transform PSScript from a prototype into a production-ready, world-class PowerShell script management platform by July 29, 2025. This roadmap addresses critical security vulnerabilities, implements modern architecture patterns, and adds enterprise-grade features.

## Current State Assessment
- **Critical Issues**: Hardcoded secrets, SQL injection risks, missing authentication checks
- **Architecture**: Monolithic with in-memory caching, no horizontal scaling
- **Testing**: No test coverage, no CI/CD pipeline
- **Security**: Multiple vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention
- **Performance**: N+1 queries, no caching strategy, synchronous processing

## Vision for July 2025
A secure, scalable, AI-powered PowerShell script management platform that:
- Handles 1M+ scripts with sub-second response times
- Supports 10K+ concurrent users
- Provides real-time collaboration features
- Offers enterprise-grade security and compliance
- Delivers 99.99% uptime SLA
