# Script Deletion Process Improvements

## Issue Identified

The script deletion process in PSScript relied solely on application logic to clean up related data when a script is deleted. This approach is potentially fragile because:

1. If an error occurs during the multi-step deletion process in the controller, orphaned records could remain in the database.
2. If a script is deleted through other means (e.g., direct database manipulation), related data would not be automatically cleaned up.

## Solution Implemented

We've enhanced the script deletion process by adding database-level `ON DELETE CASCADE` constraints to all foreign key references to the `scripts` table. This ensures that when a script is deleted, all related data in dependent tables is automatically deleted by the database, providing a robust safety net.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated Schema Definition**: Modified `src/db/schema.sql` to include `ON DELETE CASCADE` for all foreign key references to `scripts(id)` in the following tables:
   - `script_versions`
   - `script_tags`
   - `script_analysis`
   - `script_embeddings`
   - `script_dependencies` (both parent and child references)
   - `execution_logs`
   - `user_favorites`
   - `comments`

2. **Created Migration**: Added a new migration file `src/db/migrations/07_add_cascade_delete_constraints.sql` that:
   - Identifies existing foreign key constraints
   - Drops them
   - Recreates them with `ON DELETE CASCADE`
   - Handles error cases gracefully

## How to Apply These Changes

The changes to the schema file (`schema.sql`) will apply to new database setups. For existing databases, you need to run the migration:

```bash
node run-migration.js
```

This will automatically detect and apply the new migration to add cascade delete constraints.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Data Integrity**: Ensures no orphaned records are left in the database when a script is deleted.
2. **Reduced Application Logic**: The application no longer needs to handle all deletion logic, as the database will automatically clean up related records.
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Regardless of how a script is deleted (via API, UI, or direct database access), related data will always be properly cleaned up.

## Verification

After applying the migration, you can verify the changes by:

1. Running the existing script deletion test:
   ```bash
   ./run-script-deletion-test.sh
   ```

2. Manually testing script deletion through the UI to ensure all related data is properly removed.

## Note

The existing application logic in `ScriptController.ts` that explicitly deletes related records can remain in place as an additional safety measure. With the database constraints in place, this becomes a "belt and suspenders" approach to ensure data integrity.
