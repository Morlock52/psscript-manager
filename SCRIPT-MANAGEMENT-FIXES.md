# Script Management Features Fixes

## Issues Identified

After reviewing the script management features, I've identified the following issues:

1. **Duplicate Route**: There's a duplicate route for `/scripts/generate` in the routes file, which could cause confusion and potential issues.
2. **Authentication Disabled**: The authentication middleware is commented out in many routes, which could be a security issue in a production environment.
3. **Variable Reference Error**: In the chat service, the `useMockMode` variable is referenced before it's defined.
4. **Script Upload Edge Cases**: The script upload feature has complex error handling, but there might be edge cases not covered.
5. **Field Naming Inconsistencies**: As identified in the script analysis fix, there are inconsistencies in field naming between the frontend and backend.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Script Analysis Page

- Created `src/ai/main_mock_fixed.py` with consistent field naming
- Updated `docker-compose.override.yml` to use the fixed mock AI service
- Created `restart-services.sh` to restart the services with the updated configuration

### 2. Additional Recommended Fixes

#### 2.1. Fix Duplicate Route

The routes file contains two implementations of the `/scripts/generate` endpoint. To fix this:

```javascript
// Remove the second implementation of the route
// Keep only the first implementation at line ~500
```

#### 2.2. Enable Authentication

For a production environment, authentication should be enabled:

```javascript
// Uncomment the authentication middleware in routes
router.post('/', authenticateJWT, ScriptController.createScript);
router.put('/:id', authenticateJWT, ScriptController.updateScript);
router.delete('/:id', authenticateJWT, ScriptController.deleteScript);
// ... and so on for other routes
```

#### 2.3. Fix Variable Reference Error

In `src/frontend/src/services/api.ts`, the `useMockMode` variable is referenced before it's defined:

```javascript
// Fix the variable reference error
// Change:
if (useMockMode) {
  console.log("Using mock mode for chat service");
}

// To:
const useMockMode = localStorage.getItem('psscript_mock_mode') === 'true' || 
                    import.meta.env.DEV;
if (useMockMode) {
  console.log("Using mock mode for chat service");
}
```

#### 2.4. Improve Script Upload Error Handling

Add additional error handling for edge cases in the script upload feature:

```javascript
// Add handling for file size limits
if (err.response && err.response.status === 413) {
  throw new Error('The file is too large. Maximum file size is 10MB.');
}

// Add handling for unsupported file types
if (status === 400 && responseData.error === 'unsupported_file_type') {
  throw new Error('Unsupported file type. Please upload a PowerShell script (.ps1 file).');
}
```

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. Run the restart script to apply the script analysis fix:
   ```bash
   ./restart-services.sh
   ```

2. For the additional recommended fixes, you would need to modify the respective files:
   - `src/backend/src/routes/scripts.ts` - Remove the duplicate route and uncomment authentication
   - `src/frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Fix the variable reference error and improve error handling

## Testing

After applying the fixes, test the following functionality:

1. Script analysis page at http://localhost:3002/scripts/10/analysis
2. Script upload functionality
3. Script execution
4. Script search and filtering
5. Script deletion

## Additional Notes

- The authentication middleware is commented out in the routes file, which suggests that the application might be in development mode. In a production environment, authentication should be enabled.
- The script upload feature has complex error handling, but there might be edge cases not covered. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling for production use.
