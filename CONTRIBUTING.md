## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- PostgreSQL (v14+) with pgvector extension
- Python (v3.9+)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone your fork of the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Morlock52/psscript-manager.git
   cd psscript-manager
   ```

2. Set up environment variables
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your configuration.

3. Start the containers using the automated setup script. This sets up
   PostgreSQL and Redis automatically and checks for prerequisites:
   ```bash
   ./setup-check.sh dev   # or 'prod'
   ```

4. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd src/backend
   npm install

   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd ../frontend
   npm install

   # Install AI service dependencies
   cd ../ai
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. If you need to rebuild the containers after pulling updates, run:
   ```bash
   ./update-app.sh dev   # or 'prod'
   ```
