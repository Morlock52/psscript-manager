# PSScript Website Manual Test Report

**Date:** August 1, 2025  
**Frontend URL:** http://localhost:3002  
**Backend API URL:** http://localhost:4005/api  

## Test Summary

### Critical Issues Found:

1. **Frontend Rendering Issue**
   - The homepage loads with a blank white page
   - No navigation menu, main content, or UI elements are visible
   - Page title is correctly set to "PSScript - PowerShell Script Management"
   - Vite development server is failing to serve client modules properly

2. **JavaScript Errors**
   - Multiple 404 errors for `/@vite/client` module
   - The Vite dev server returns HTML content instead of JavaScript modules
   - This prevents React from loading and rendering the application

3. **Missing UI Components**
   - No navigation bar present (`<nav>` element not found)
   - No main content area (`<main>` element not found)
   - No buttons or interactive elements rendered
   - No links available for navigation testing

4. **Authentication Issues**
   - Cannot test login functionality as no UI is rendered
   - Login endpoint `/api/auth/login` returns 404 (endpoint may not exist)
   - Cannot navigate to login page

### Working Components:

1. **Backend API Health**
   - Health endpoint working correctly at `/api/health`
   - Database connection is healthy (PostgreSQL)
   - Redis cache is connected
   - Server uptime: ~27 minutes

2. **API Endpoints Status**
   - `/api/health` - 200 OK ✓
   - `/api/scripts` - 200 OK ✓
   - `/api/users` - 403 Forbidden (expected without auth)
   - `/api/auth/login` - 404 Not Found (missing endpoint)

3. **Page Response**
   - Homepage returns 200 OK status
   - HTML structure is present with proper DOCTYPE and meta tags
   - Page title is set correctly

4. **Accessibility (Limited Testing)**
   - No accessibility violations found (because no content is rendered)
   - HTML has proper lang attribute
   - Viewport meta tag is present

### Root Cause Analysis:

The primary issue appears to be with the Vite development server configuration or the React application failing to bootstrap. The server is returning the index.html file for all requests, including module requests, which is causing the application to fail to load.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Fixes:**
   - Restart the Vite development server
   - Check Vite configuration file for any misconfigurations
   - Verify that all frontend dependencies are properly installed
   - Check for any build errors in the frontend console

2. **Frontend Debugging:**
   - Check browser developer console for additional errors
   - Verify that `src/main.tsx` exists and is valid
   - Check if React and other dependencies are properly installed
   - Review Vite config for any proxy or server settings issues

3. **API Completeness:**
   - Implement missing `/api/auth/login` endpoint
   - Ensure all required API endpoints are available

4. **Testing Infrastructure:**
   - Consider adding E2E tests with Playwright or Cypress
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints
   - Implement visual regression testing

### Test Environment Details:

- **Platform:** macOS Darwin 25.0.0
- **Node Version:** v22.16.0
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16.9
- **Backend Status:** Healthy and running
- **Frontend Status:** Running but not rendering content

### Conclusion:

The PSScript website is currently non-functional due to a critical frontend rendering issue. While the backend API is healthy and responsive, the frontend application fails to load, preventing any user interaction or testing of features. This appears to be a development environment configuration issue rather than a code problem.

**Priority:** Critical - The application is completely unusable in its current state.
