# Script Deletion Process Fixes

This document outlines all the comprehensive fixes and enhancements applied to the script deletion process in the PSScript application. The changes improve consistency, reliability, error reporting, and overall data integrity.

---

## 1. Missing Transaction Type Import

**Issue:**  
In the file `src/backend/src/utils/vectorUtils.ts`, the `Transaction` type was not imported, which could lead to TypeScript errors and lack of type safety.

**Fix:**  
The missing import has been added:

```typescript
import { Transaction } from 'sequelize';
```

## 2. Improved Script ID Handling in Bulk Deletion

**Issue:**  
The bulk deletion endpoint originally converted IDs using `parseInt` without discriminating between string and numeric types. This sometimes resulted in improper conversion, and the error handling did not clearly indicate which IDs were invalid.

**Fixes:**

- **Enhanced Type Handling:**  
  Script IDs are now processed to correctly handle both string and number types before filtering for invalid values.

  **Before:**

  ```typescript
  const numericIds = ids.map(id => parseInt(id, 10)).filter(id => !isNaN(id));
  ```

  **After:**

  ```typescript
  const numericIds = ids.map(id => typeof id === 'string' ? parseInt(id, 10) : id)
                        .filter(id => !isNaN(id) && Number.isInteger(id));
  ```

- **Detailed Error Reporting:**  
  If any ID fails validation, the API now returns a comprehensive error response that includes the list of invalid IDs:

  ```typescript
  return res.status(400).json({ 
    message: 'Invalid input: All IDs must be valid integers.', 
    success: false,
    invalidIds: ids.filter(id => {
      const num = typeof id === 'string' ? parseInt(id, 10) : id;
      return isNaN(num) || !Number.isInteger(num);
    })
  });
  ```

## 3. Consistent Column Naming in Deletion Methods

**Issue:**  
There was inconsistent use of column names when deleting related records. For instance, the `deleteScript` method used `script_id` in one case, while elsewhere `scriptId` was used.

**Fix:**  
All deletion operations now uniformly use `scriptId` for consistency. For example:

**Before:**

```typescript
await ExecutionLog.destroy({ where: { script_id: scriptId }, transaction });
```

**After:**

```typescript
await ExecutionLog.destroy({ where: { scriptId }, transaction });
```

This uniform naming is applied across both the `deleteScript` and `deleteMultipleScripts` methods.

## 4. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging

**Issue:**  
The error handling in deletion processes was not robust enoughâ€”errors during transaction rollbacks or during individual deletions in bulk operations were not comprehensively logged.

**Fix:**  
Improved error handling now captures:
- Detailed error messages and stack traces.
- Clear logs for each failed deletion within bulk operations.
- Warnings for transactions that are rolled back due to an error.

These changes help simplify debugging and ensure the deletion process is more resilient.

## 5. Database Cascade Constraints for Data Integrity

**Issue:**  
To maintain data integrity, when a script is deleted, all its related records in dependent tables must also be removed automatically.

**Fix:**  
Database-level cascade constraints have been implemented in the migration file:  
`src/db/migrations/07_add_cascade_delete_constraints.sql`

When these constraints are applied, deletion of a script automatically triggers the removal of associated records (e.g., analysis, versions, execution logs, and tag associations).

**To apply these constraints in an existing database:**

```bash
./run-cascade-delete-migration.sh
```

---

## 6. Testing and Verification

Proper testing of the deletion process is essential. Use the following command to run the deletion tests:

```bash
./run-script-deletion-test.sh
```

This test script validates:
- Single script deletion.
- Bulk deletion with the updated ID handling.
- Verification that cascade constraints correctly remove all related records.

---

## Conclusion

The modifications introduced ensure a robust, consistent, and secure script deletion process. Key enhancements include:

- **TypeScript Safety:** Importing `Transaction` for proper type checking.
- **Robust ID Handling:** Precisely processing both string and number types, with detailed error reporting.
- **Consistency:** Uniform naming conventions across deletion functions.
- **Resilience:** Enhanced logging and error handling for improved debugging.
- **Data Integrity:** Implementation of cascade deletion constraints at the database level.
