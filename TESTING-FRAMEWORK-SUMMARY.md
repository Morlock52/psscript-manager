# PSScript Platform Testing Framework Summary

## Overview

This testing framework provides a comprehensive solution for testing the PSScript platform's core features: uploading, storing, AI analyzing, removal functions, and the knowledge section. The framework includes test plans, test scripts, sample data, and documentation to ensure all features work as intended.

## Test Categories

The testing framework covers the following categories:

1. **Uploading Function**
   - Direct content upload
   - File upload
   - Large file upload
   - Duplicate detection
   - Content validation

2. **Storing Function**
   - Script metadata storage
   - Version control
   - Categorization and tagging
   - Public/private settings

3. **AI Analyzing Function**
   - Basic script analysis
   - Security analysis
   - Code quality analysis
   - Multi-agent system
   - Vector similarity search

4. **Removal Function**
   - Basic script deletion
   - Cascading deletion
   - Authorization checks
   - Bulk deletion

5. **Knowledge Section**
   - Assistants API integration
   - Thread management
   - Tool use
   - Documentation integration

## Usage Workflow

1. **Setup and Verification**
   ```bash
   ./verify-test-setup.sh
   ```

2. **Running Tests**
   - Run all tests:
     ```bash
     ./test-psscript-core.sh
     ```
   - Run a specific test:
     ```bash
     ./run-specific-test.sh [test_name]
     ```
   - Run tests against a deployment:
     ```bash
     ./run-deployment-tests.sh [deployment_url]
     ```

3. **Packaging for Distribution**
   ```bash
   ./package-tests.sh
   ```
   
4. **Verify and Package in One Step**
   ```bash
   ./prepare-and-package.sh
   ```

## Test Results

When running tests with `run-deployment-tests.sh`, results are saved to:
- `test-results/[timestamp]/test-results.log` - Full test log
- `test-results/[timestamp]/summary.md` - Summary report

## Extending the Framework

To add new test cases:
1. Update the `testplan.md` file with new test cases
2. Add new functions to the `test-psscript-core.sh` script
3. Create additional test scripts or data files as needed
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Verify your changes with `./verify-test-setup.sh`

## Deployment Considerations

For testing in a deployment environment:
1. Package the tests using `./package-tests.sh`
2. Transfer the package to the deployment environment
3. Extract the package and run the tests
4. Review the test results and summary report

## Security Considerations

- The test scripts use default admin credentials (admin@example.com/adminpassword)
- For production testing, update these credentials in the scripts
- All test data is cleaned up after tests complete

## Conclusion

This testing framework provides a comprehensive solution for testing the PSScript platform. By following the test plan and using the provided scripts, you can ensure that all core features work as intended, both individually and together.
