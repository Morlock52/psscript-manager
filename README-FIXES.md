# PSScript Application Fixes

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the fixes implemented for the PSScript application to address critical issues with script deletion and file uploads.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Script Deletion Error
When clicking the trash can icon to delete a script, an error message "Failed to delete script(s). Please try again." was displayed. The script was not being deleted from the database, and the UI was not updating correctly.

### 2. Network Error During Upload
When attempting to upload a script file, a "Network error. Please check your connection." message was displayed. The file was not being uploaded to the server, and no error details were provided.

## Technical Fixes Implemented

### Backend Fixes

#### 1. Enhanced Transaction Management in ScriptController
- Improved transaction handling with proper rollbacks in case of errors
- Added detailed error responses with success flags
- Fixed error handling for transaction rollbacks

```typescript
// Rollback transaction if there was an error
if (transaction) {
  try {
    await transaction.rollback();
  } catch (rollbackError) {
    console.error('Error rolling back transaction:', rollbackError);
  }
}

// Return a structured error response
res.status(500).json({
  message: 'Failed to delete script',
  error: error.message,
  success: false
});
```

#### 2. Improved CORS Middleware
- Enhanced CORS handling to properly support file uploads
- Added support for credentials and proper origin handling
- Fixed issues with preflight requests

```typescript
// Get the origin from the request
const origin = req.headers.origin || '*';

// Add permissive CORS headers specifically for file uploads
res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin);
res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, OPTIONS');
res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, x-openai-api-key, x-api-key');
res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true');
res.header('Access-Control-Max-Age', '86400'); // 24 hours
```

#### 3. Network Error Handling Middleware
- Added middleware to handle network errors during uploads
- Implemented timeout handling for upload requests
- Added detailed error responses for different failure scenarios

```typescript
// Middleware to handle network errors during upload
const handleNetworkErrors = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  // Set a longer timeout for upload requests
  req.setTimeout(120000); // 2 minutes
  
  // Handle connection close events
  req.on('close', () => {
    if (!res.headersSent) {
      logger.warn('[UPLOAD] Client closed connection before response was sent');
    }
  });
  
  // Handle timeout events
  req.on('timeout', () => {
    logger.error('[UPLOAD] Request timeout');
    if (!res.headersSent) {
      res.status(408).json({
        error: 'request_timeout',
        message: 'The request timed out. Please try again with a smaller file or better connection.',
        success: false
      });
    }
  });
  
  next();
};
```

#### 4. Updated Routes Configuration
- Applied the network error handling middleware to upload routes
- Ensured proper middleware order for uploads

```typescript
// Use special CORS middleware and network error handling for upload endpoints
router.post('/upload', uploadCorsMiddleware, handleNetworkErrors, upload.single('script_file'), handleMulterError, ScriptController.uploadScript);
```

### Frontend Fixes

#### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in API Service
- Improved error handling for script deletion
- Added specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Ensured proper error propagation to the UI

```typescript
deleteScript: async (id: string) => {
  try {
    const response = await apiClient.delete(`/scripts/${id}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error deleting script ${id}:`, error);
    
    // Provide more specific error messages
    if ((error as any).status === 404) {
      throw new Error('Script not found. It may have been already deleted.');
    }
    
    if ((error as any).status === 403) {
      throw new Error('You do not have permission to delete this script.');
    }
    
    // Return a structured error object
    throw {
      message: (error as any).message || 'Failed to delete script',
      status: (error as any).status || 500,
      success: false
    };
  }
}
```

#### 2. Improved React Query Mutation Handling
- Enhanced the delete script mutation in ScriptManagement.tsx
- Added proper success and error handling
- Implemented user-friendly error messages

```typescript
// Delete script mutation with improved error handling
const deleteScriptMutation = useMutation(
  (id: string) => scriptService.deleteScript(id),
  {
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      if (data.success) {
        // Show success toast or notification
        console.log('Script deleted successfully');
        queryClient.invalidateQueries('scripts');
      }
    },
    onError: (error: any) => {
      // Show error toast or notification
      console.error('Failed to delete script:', error);
      alert(error.message || 'Failed to delete script. Please try again.');
    }
  }
);
```

## Testing the Fixes

### Restart Scripts

Several scripts have been created to restart the application with the fixes:

1. **restart-backend.sh**: Restarts only the backend server
2. **restart-frontend.sh**: Restarts only the frontend server
3. **restart-all.sh**: Restarts both the backend and frontend servers

To restart the entire application:

```bash
./restart-all.sh
```

### Testing Scripts

Two testing scripts have been created to verify the fixes:

1. **test-fixes.sh**: Tests the backend API directly using curl
2. **test-ui-fixes.sh**: Opens the browser to test the UI fixes

#### Backend API Testing

To test the backend API directly:

```bash
./test-fixes.sh
```

This script will:
- Test script deletion by sending a DELETE request to the API
- Test script upload by sending a POST request with a test script file

#### UI Testing

To test the UI fixes:

```bash
./test-ui-fixes.sh
```

This script will:
- Open the script management page to test deletion
- Open the upload page to test file uploads
- Provide instructions for manual testing

### Manual Testing Steps

#### Testing Script Deletion:
1. Navigate to the script management page (http://localhost:3000/manage)
2. Find a script in the list
3. Click the 'Delete' button (trash can icon)
4. Confirm the deletion in the dialog
5. Verify that the script is removed without errors

#### Testing Script Upload:
1. Navigate to the upload page (http://localhost:3000/upload)
2. Click 'Choose File' or drag and drop a PowerShell script
3. Fill in the title and description
4. Click 'Upload'
5. Verify that the upload completes without network errors

## Conclusion

These fixes address the core issues with script deletion and file uploads in the PSScript application. The improved error handling, transaction management, and CORS configuration ensure a more robust user experience.
