# Script Analysis Page Fix

## Issue

The script analysis page at http://localhost:3002/scripts/10/analysis was not displaying correctly due to an issue with the mock AI service. The problem was in the data structure returned by the mock AI service for script ID 10.

## Root Cause

After examining the code, I found that the mock AI service (`main_mock.py`) had an issue with the data structure it returned for script ID 10. Specifically:

1. The `performanceInsights` field was being returned with the wrong key name in the response for script ID 10.
2. The `best_practice_violations` field was being returned with the wrong key name.
3. These naming inconsistencies caused the frontend to not properly display the data.

## Solution

I created a fixed version of the mock AI service (`main_mock_fixed.py`) that ensures consistent field naming in the response. The key changes include:

1. Ensuring the `performanceInsights` field is consistently named in the response.
2. Ensuring the `best_practice_violations` field is consistently named in the response.
3. Updated the docker-compose.override.yml file to use the fixed mock AI service.

## Implementation

The following files were modified:

1. Created `src/ai/main_mock_fixed.py` - A fixed version of the mock AI service.
2. Updated `docker-compose.override.yml` - Changed the command to use the fixed mock AI service.
3. Created `restart-services.sh` - A script to restart the services with the updated configuration.

## How to Test

1. Run the restart script to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   ./restart-services.sh
   ```

2. Once the services are restarted, access the script analysis page at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3002/scripts/10/analysis
   ```

3. Verify that all tabs (Overview, Security, Code Quality, Performance, Parameters, and Psscript AI) display correctly.

## Additional Notes

- The fix ensures that the mock AI service returns a consistent data structure that matches what the frontend expects.
- This is a temporary fix for development purposes. In a production environment, the actual AI service would be used instead of the mock service.
