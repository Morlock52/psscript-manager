   - Some error messages lack context or actionable information
   - Inconsistent approach to retries and fallbacks

3. **Limited Documentation of Integration Points**
   - Gaps in documentation of how components interact
   - Unclear API contracts between some services
   - Missing documentation for extending the platform

4. **Monolithic Aspects in AI Service**
   - Some functionality in the AI service is tightly integrated
   - Limited separation between agent logic and API endpoints
   - Potential scalability challenges for compute-intensive operations

## Voice API Integration Strategy

### Strategic Approach

The Voice API integration will follow a microservices-oriented approach that:

1. **Preserves Existing Functionality**: Ensures all current features continue to work without disruption
2. **Minimizes Coupling**: Introduces new components with clean interfaces to existing systems
3. **Maximizes Reusability**: Designs voice components to be reusable across different parts of the application
4. **Ensures Scalability**: Implements voice processing in a way that can scale independently of other components

### Architectural Principles

The rebuild strategy is guided by the following architectural principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Interface-Based Design**: Components interact through well-defined interfaces
3. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules
4. **Fail Fast, Fail Gracefully**: Detect failures early and provide graceful degradation
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Voice features enhance but do not replace existing functionality
