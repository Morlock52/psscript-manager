# Voice API Issues and Solutions

This document outlines the issues identified in the Voice API implementation and the solutions implemented to address them.

## 1. Missing Time Import in voice_service.py

### Issue
The `voice_service.py` file was using the `time` module in the `_get_from_cache` method, but the module was not imported at the top of the file.

### Solution
Added the missing import statement:
```python
import time
```

## 2. Potential Memory Leak in Caching Mechanism

### Issue
The caching mechanism in `voice_service.py` had no size limits or periodic cleanup, which could lead to memory leaks over time.

### Solution
Implemented an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with size limits and periodic cleanup:
- Added a maximum cache size configuration via environment variable `TTS_CACHE_MAX_SIZE`
- Implemented cache entry eviction when the cache exceeds the maximum size
- Added a thread-safe cache lock using `asyncio.Lock()`
- Implemented periodic cache cleanup that runs every 1/4 of the cache TTL period
- Updated cache methods to be async and use the lock for thread safety

## 3. Configurable Amazon S3 Bucket Name

### Issue
The Amazon S3 bucket name used in the `_recognize_amazon` method was hardcoded, making it difficult to configure for different environments.

### Solution
Made the S3 bucket name configurable via an environment variable:
```python
# Get S3 bucket name from environment variable or use default
bucket_name = os.environ.get("VOICE_S3_BUCKET", "psscript-voice-api")
```

## 4. Improved Exception Handling

### Issue
The exception handling in `voice_endpoints.py` was too generic, catching all exceptions and returning a 500 error without specific error messages or proper logging.

### Solution
Implemented more specific exception handling:
- Added input validation for request parameters
- Added specific handling for different types of exceptions (ValueError, HTTPException)
- Added logging for errors to aid in debugging
- Improved error messages to provide more context

## 5. Enhanced API Key Security

### Issue
The API key validation in `voice_endpoints.py` was minimal, with no format validation or checking against allowed keys.

### Solution
Implemented enhanced API key validation:
- Added format validation (must start with "voice_" and be at least 20 characters)
- Added validation against a list of allowed keys from an environment variable
- Improved error messages for invalid API keys

## 6. MCP Server for Voice Provider Management

### Issue
There was no centralized way to manage voice service providers and their API keys.

### Solution
Created an MCP server for managing voice service providers:
- Implemented tools for adding, updating, and retrieving voice provider configurations
- Added support for multiple providers (Google, Amazon, Azure)
- Implemented configuration persistence
- Added the MCP server to the Claude settings file

## Summary of Changes

1. **voice_service.py**:
   - Added missing time import
   - Implemented LRU cache with size limits
   - Added periodic cache cleanup
   - Made Amazon S3 bucket name configurable

2. **voice_endpoints.py**:
   - Improved exception handling
   - Enhanced API key security
   - Added input validation

3. **MCP Server**:
   - Created a new MCP server for managing voice providers
   - Implemented configuration persistence
   - Added tools for managing providers and API keys

These changes have significantly improved the reliability, security, and maintainability of the Voice API implementation.
