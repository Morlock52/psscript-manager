## Frontend Configuration

The AI Features component is located at:
- `/src/frontend/src/components/AIFeatures.tsx`

It makes API calls to:
- Base URL: `http://localhost:4000/api`
- Endpoints: `/ai-features/*`

## Common Issues

1. **No scripts available**: Make sure you have uploaded at least one script
2. **API key required**: Some features may require an OpenAI API key
3. **Script selection**: Many features require selecting a script first

## How to Access

1. Navigate to the AI Features page in the app
2. Select a script from the dropdown (if you have any)
3. Click on any feature card to execute it
4. Results will appear below the feature grid
